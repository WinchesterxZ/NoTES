Congrats — you found all fragments and reached this file.

Below is the list that should be live on the site. If you replace the contents of
/home/socmas/2025/wishlist.txt with this exact list (one item per line, no numbering),
the site will recognise it and the takeover glitching will stop. Do it — it will save the site.

Hardware security keys (YubiKey or similar)
Commercial password manager subscriptions (team seats)
Endpoint detection & response (EDR) licenses
Secure remote access appliances (jump boxes)
Cloud workload scanning credits (container/image scanning)
Threat intelligence feed subscription

Secure code review / SAST tool access
Dedicated secure test lab VM pool
Incident response runbook templates and playbooks
Electronic safe drive with encrypted backups

A final note — I don't know exactly where they have me, but there are *lots* of eggs
and I can smell chocolate in the air. Something big is coming.  — McSkidy

When the wishlist is corrected, the site will show a block of ciphertext. This ciphertext can be decrypted with the following unlock key:

UNLOCK_KEY: 91J6X7R4FQ9TQPM9JX2Q9X2Z

To decode the ciphertext, use OpenSSL. For instance, if you copied the ciphertext into a file /tmp/website_output.txt you could decode using the following command:

cat > /tmp/website_output.txt
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 -salt -base64 -in /tmp/website_output.txt -out /tmp/decoded_message.txt -pass pass:'91J6X7R4FQ9TQPM9JX2Q9X2Z'
cat /tmp/decoded_message.txt

Sorry to be so convoluted, I couldn't risk making this easy while King Malhare watches. — McSkidy


Well done — the glitch is fixed. Amazing job going the extra mile and saving the site. Take this flag THM{w3lcome_2_A0c_2025}

NEXT STEP:
If you fancy something a little...spicier....use the FLAG you just obtained as the passphrase to unlock:
/home/eddi_knapp/.secret/dir

That hidden directory has been archived and encrypted with the FLAG.
Inside it you'll find the sidequest key.
