To: whoever finds this

I had a short second when no one was watching. I used it.

I've managed to plant a few clues around the account.
If you can get into the user below and look carefully,
those three little "easter eggs" will combine into a passcode
that unlocks a further message that I encrypted in the
/home/eddi_knapp/Documents/ directory.
I didn't want the wrong eyes to see it.

Access the user account:
username: eddi_knapp
password: S0mething1Sc0ming

There are three hidden easter eggs.
They combine to form the passcode to open my encrypted vault.

Clues (one for each egg):
3ast3r-1s-c0M1nG
1)
I ride with your session, not with your chest of files.
Open the little bag your shell carries when you arrive.

PASSFRAG1=3ast3r

2)
The tree shows today; the rings remember yesterday.
Read the ledger’s older pages.
PASSFRAG2: -1s-
3)
When pixels sleep, their tails sometimes whisper plain words.
Listen to the tail.
PASSFRAG3: c0M1nG
Find the fragments, join them in order, and use the resulting passcode
to decrypt the message I left. Be careful — I had to be quick,
and I left only enough to get help.
