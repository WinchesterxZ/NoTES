Android : 

linux based system with some differences
  arch (java as high level language )  -> low level (dalvik vm)
  
  pic -> p58 in book 
  
  Layers (application layer for now )
  
  App layer only responsible for handlin all user apps ( user apps run on it)
  ِِApp API -------------------------------------------------------------------
  anroid.*     -> android commnicate with api to grante the premssion
  Binder----------------------------------------------  Binder responsible for IPC(interproces communication)
  
  if app(A) wants to access process form app(B) itss not acceptable unless it uses binder first 
  
  Dalvik (this the place java converts to as java bytes code so dalvik vm can understand it and work on it)
  - javabyte code extension is file.dex  and after dex it turns to smali
  JNI------ Java Native Interface is a programming framework that enables Java code running within a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to
  interact with applications and libraries written in other programming languages, such as C, C++, and assembly--------------
  # all the previous things is manged by linux kernerl 
  


# app A cant directly communicate with app B
because of SANDBOXING 

Each app runs in its own sandbox, with: different UID ,isolated storage ,restricted access to other apps

So app A cannot read/write app B’s files or memory.

- each app has a (newuser and directory) withe diffrent premiision of another app for example rwx--------- (owner,group,others)
so no other app can access it 

so waht if we need premisisons like network there it comes the use AIDs defined in /android_filesystem_config.h
it has predfined permisions and we juust inherti them 


# Android Mainfest -> has all persisions and activites 
 Applications’ permissions are extracted from 
the application’s manifest at install time by the PackageManager and stored in 
/data/system/packages.xml. These entries are then used to grant the appropriaterights at the instantiation of the app’s process
بمعنى الباكدج فيه كل البرميشن بتاه كل الابلكيشن 
انما المانفست فيه البرميشن الي مقدرش اتسغنى عنها 




# System app (/system/app) vs userapp (/data/app)

#Android Components : any info about them in android manifest

#Activites : any page in my app is called an activity 
Explicit Intents, which directly name a target component (like starting another activity in your own app)
Implicit Intents, which declare a general action (like sharing or viewing a map) for the system to find a suitable app to handle it,
 enabling cross-app communication
#Broadcast reciver : allows applications to listen for and respond to system-wide or application-specific broadcast messages, also known as Intents. These broadcasts can originate from the Android operating system itself 
(e.g., battery low, network connectivity change, incoming SMS) 
#Service : code that run in backround withouut intracting with user 
#Content Provider : component that manages access to a central repository of data, allowing applications to share data with each other 
or to abstract data access within a single application


first process to run in android boot is zygote it calls init.rc

# USer space native code has all services and libriaries to make functionality internal 
# kernal space native code all services and programmes runs in kerenl level
