HAHAHA heard they locked up my old boss Hopper. GOOD! ITS WHERE HE BELONGS , The red team battalion has been WAY better since I took control.

Trying my hand at some bruteforcing challenges on thm, good to see they have /opt/hashcat-utils/src/combinator.bin on the AttackBox! Always comes in handy
Happy 43rd anniversary to the year I was born. Yep 1982! What a year for the world.

Your royal egg-cellence
