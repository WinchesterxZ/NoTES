Mitigations 
Chains ( how to get another vuln from the original vuln)



Os Command Injection 
Direct -> u see result direct in response (in band)
blind -> there is an os command injection but result not seen (time based for ex) (sleeping - ping)
OOB (out of band) -> caNT GET DIRECT response sent ouut to external source like webhook 


RCE vs OSCI   (Interview Question)

RCE -> u get full shell to execute whatever u want 
OSCI -> its related to only the parameter tht is vulnerable and only command injection 



|ping -c 10 127.0.0.1

&& excut second onl if first ocuured
