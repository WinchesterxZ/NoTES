@get all logs
adb logcat --pid=$(adb shell pidof -s jakhar.aseem.diva)

# see all granted permissions
adb shell dumpsys package com.jakhar.aseem.diva | grep granted=true

#give some permission 
adb shell pm grant jakhar.aseem.diva android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
adb shell pm grant jakhar.aseem.diva android.permission.ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION

adb logcat
adb logcat -v <log_format>
Change the log format - for example using brief to get a more condensed version of the log.

Log Filtering
In some cases there can be lots of log entries which makes it hard to focus on the things that matter. For example if you are only interested in the logs produced by the MainActivity, you can use a log filter for that:

adb logcat "MainActivity:V *:S"
Filter format:

MainActivity:V ensures that logs from the tag MainActivity with a severity of Verbose and above are logged
*:S Ensures that all other Tags are ignored (as nothing will log with log-level Silent or above)
Logging severities:

      	Log level
V	Verbose
D	Debug
I	Info
W	Warning
E	Error
F	Fatal
S	Silent

Getting APKs from a device
First, find the package name of the application you want to download. You can list all third-party packages using:

adb shell pm list packages -3
Next, we have to get the path to the APK. This can be done using:

adb shell pm path <package_name>
Now we can just pull the APK from the phone:

adb pull <path_to_apk>


Using 
apktool d <path_to_apk> we can extract APKs.
