## 1. How does a browser work?

- **URL input** – You type a link or click one.
- **Cache lookup** – Browser checks disk for a saved version.
- **DNS resolution** – Determines the server’s IP  
  (your device → router → ISP → DNS servers).
- **TCP + HTTPS handshake** – A secure connection is established.
- **HTTP request sent** – Browser sends the request.
- **Server response** – Returns HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.
- **HTML parsed → DOM created**
- **CSS parsed → CSSOM created → Render tree built**
- **JavaScript executed** – Updates or manipulates the DOM.
- **Rendering** – Final page displayed to the user.

## What does API mean?

- **API = Application Programming Interface**, a contract that allows apps to communicate.
- Like a restaurant menu:  
  You request `GET /weather?city=Cairo`, the server returns JSON with the temperature.  
  You don’t need to know how the server works internally.  
- Common example: **“Login with Google”** uses Google’s Identity API.

## 2. What technology allows opening multiple browser tabs in parallel?

- JavaScript supports async operations, but the real magic is the **browser architecture**.
- Chrome uses **Multi-Process Architecture (MPA)**:  
  **Each tab runs in its own isolated process**, each with its own memory.  
  If one tab crashes → others stay alive.

## 3. Common browser-handled headers

- The **browser** automatically sets standard request headers like:  
  `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Accept`, `Cookie`, etc.
- Developers set **custom request headers** and configure server **response headers** such as:  
  `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, etc.

## 4. Common developer-controlled headers

- `Content-Type` – Defines the format of the request body (e.g., JSON).
- `Authorization` – Sends JWTs, API tokens, keys, etc.
- `Cache-Control` – Controls caching behavior.
- `X-Requested-With` – Identifies AJAX requests.
- **Custom headers** – e.g., `X-API-Key`, `Client-Version`.
- `Access-Control-*` – Server-side headers used for CORS.

## What happens when you connect an Ethernet cable and open google.com?

1. **Ethernet connection established** – Laptop receives an IP via DHCP.
2. **DNS lookup** – Resolves `google.com` into an IP address.
3. **TCP + TLS handshake** – Creates a secure connection with Google.
4. **HTTP request sent** – Browser asks for the homepage.
5. **Server response** – Returns HTML, CSS, JS, images.
6. **Rendering** – Browser builds DOM/CSSOM, executes JS, and displays the page.

## 6. Difference between a class and an object

- **Class** → A blueprint defining attributes and methods.
- **Object** → A real instance created from that class, stored in memory.

---

## 7. What is inheritance?

**Inheritance** allows a child class to **reuse and extend** properties and methods from a parent class, promoting cleaner and more structured code.

---

## What is `chmod` in Linux?

`chmod` (change mode) modifies **file or directory permissions**, controlling read, write, and execute access.

---

## What is `+x` in Linux?

`+x` adds **execute permission**, allowing a file to run as a program or script.

---

## What are `re`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `requests` in Python?

- **`re`** – Regular expressions for pattern matching and text searching.
- **`BeautifulSoup`** – Parses and extracts data from HTML/XML (used in web scraping).
- **`requests`** – Sends HTTP requests like GET and POST for interacting with web pages or APIs.
