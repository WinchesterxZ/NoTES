# Lab2 Username enumeration via response timing

- This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration using its response times. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

- Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
- [Candidate usernames](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)
- [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

- the lab has some block filter for the ip so lets try to add header 
```
X-Forwarded-For: 1
```

- cool now we are unblocked so we will enmurate the users with changing the forward ip

- Notice this user takes much longer than the others
