# Lab1 Username enumeration via subtly different responses

- This lab is subtly vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:

Given 2 Lists 
- [Candidate usernames](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames)
- [Candidate passwords](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords)

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.
