# SSRF to Remote Code Execution (RCE)

## 1. The Core Vulnerability: Internal Access
**SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)** is not limited to fetching external websites. Its most dangerous capability is accessing the **Internal Network** or **Localhost** (127.0.0.1).

* **Mechanism:** The compromised application acts as a proxy.
* **The Advantage:** It bypasses firewalls. External attackers cannot see internal services, but the vulnerable server *is* inside the network, so it can talk to them.

## 2. Chaining for RCE (Remote Code Execution)
SSRF often starts as an information leak but can be escalated to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** by targeting specific internal services.

**High-Risk Targets for Chaining:**
* **Redis** (Most common for RCE)
* **Memcached**
* **RabbitMQ**
* **Elasticsearch**

These services are often misconfigured because administrators assume they are "safe" behind the firewall.

## 3. Common Targets in Detail

### A. Memcached
Memcached is a high-speed, in-memory NoSQL database used for caching.

* **Usage:** Often stores **Session IDs** and temporary data.
* **Why it is vulnerable:**
    * **Non-persistent:** Designed for speed, not long-term storage.
    * **No Default Auth:** It frequently requires no password to read/write data.
    * **Limited Logging:** Attacks are hard to detect post-exploitation.

### B. Redis
Redis is an in-memory data structure store, similar to Memcached but more complex.

* **Design Philosophy:** Redis is designed to run on **Trusted Internal Networks**. It does *not* prioritize security measures out-of-the-box.
* **Why it is vulnerable:**
    * **Optional Security:** Password protection is available but optional.
    * **Misconfiguration:** Many installations neglect to set a password because they assume the internal network is secure.
    * **RCE Potential:** If an attacker can talk to Redis (via SSRF), they can often write a file (like an SSH key or a cron job) to the server, gaining full control.
