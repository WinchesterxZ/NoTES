We can try obfuscating code using the same tool in [JSF](http://www.jsfuck.com/), and then rerunning it. We will notice that the code may take some time to run, which shows how code obfuscation could affect the performance, as previously mentioned.

There are many other JavaScript obfuscators, like [JJ Encode](https://utf-8.jp/public/jjencode.html) or [AA Encode](https://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html). However, such obfuscators usually make code execution/compilation very slow, so it is not recommended to be used unless for an obvious reason, like bypassing web filters or restrictions.

Furthermore, we can utilize many online tools or code editor plugins, like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/playground/) or [Beautifier](https://beautifier.io/). Let us copy the `secret.js` script:

# deobfuscate
We can find many good online tools to deobfuscate JavaScript code and turn it into something we can understand. One good tool is [UnPacker](https://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html). Let's try copying our above-obfuscated code and run it in UnPacker by clicking the `UnPack` button.
