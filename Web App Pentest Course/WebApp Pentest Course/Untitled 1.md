## 1- How does the browser work?

-  **URL entered** – You type or click a link.
    
- **Cache check** – Loads from disk if available.
    
- **DNS lookup** – Finds the server’s IP address. → Your computer → Local router → ISP → DNS servers
    
- **TCP/HTTPS handshake** – Establishes secure connection.
    
- **Request sent** – Browser sends HTTP(S) request.
    
- **Server response** – Returns HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
    
- **HTML parsed → DOM built**
    
- **CSS parsed → CSSOM built → Render tree created**
    
- **JS executed** – Manipulates DOM dynamically.
    
- **Page rendered** – Displayed to the user.

## What does api mean?

- API stands for Application Programming Interface. It’s a contract that lets two apps talk to each other.
- Think of it like a restaurant menu: I tell the waiter ‘GET /weather?city=Cairo’, the kitchen (OpenWeather server) returns JSON with temperature 24°C, and my app shows it—no need to know how the kitchen cooked it. Real-world: every ‘Login with Google’ button uses Google’s Identity API.”

## 2 - What is the model or technology that let you open multiple taps in parallel on google?


- javascript 

- Tabbed browsing = Multithreading 
- Google Chrome opens every tab in its own process (not just a thread). Each tab gets its own CPU + RAM, so if one tab crashes → others stay alive. The magic tech is called Chrome Multi-Process Architecture (MPA). One tab = one mini-Chrome.”


### 3- **Common browser-handled headers:**

- **Browser :** Handles **request headers** automatically (like `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Accept`, `Cookie`, etc.).
    
- **Developer:** Manually sets **custom request headers** (like `Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `X-API-Key`, etc.) and **response headers** on the server side (`Cache-Control`, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, etc.).

### 4- **Common developer-controlled headers:**

- `Content-Type` – Specifies the format of the request body (e.g. `application/json`).
    
- `Authorization` – For sending API tokens, JWTs, etc.
    
- `Cache-Control` – Controls caching behavior.
    
- `X-Requested-With` – Often used for AJAX requests.
    
- `Custom headers` – Any header starting with `X-` or others (e.g. `X-API-Key`, `Client-Version`).
    
- `Access-Control-*` (on server side) – Used to configure CORS responses.

## What happen when you inject the Ethernet cable in your laptop and open the browser then access google.com

- **Ethernet connected** – Laptop gets an IP via DHCP.
    
- **DNS lookup** – Resolves _google.com_ to an IP.
    
- **TCP + TLS handshake** – Secure connection with Google server.
    
- **HTTP request sent** – Browser requests the page.
    
- **Server responds** – Sends HTML, CSS, JS, etc.
    
- **Browser renders** – Builds DOM, runs JS, shows Google’s page.


## 6-	What is the difference between class and object in programming?

- **Class:** A blueprint or template that defines properties and behaviors (methods).
    
- **Object:** An instance of a class created in memory using that blueprint.


## 7-	What is inheritance in programming?

**Inheritance:** A mechanism where one class (child) **acquires properties and methods** of another class (parent) to achivee **code reuse** and **hierarchy**.

## What is chmod in linux?

`chmod` (change mode) is a Linux command used to **change file or directory permissions**  controlling who can **read, write, or execute** it.

## What is +x in linux?

`+x` adds the **execute permission** to a file in Linux, allowing it to be run 

## What is re,beautifulsoup,requests libraries in python?

- **`re`** → Handles **regular expressions** for pattern matching and text searching.
    
- **`BeautifulSoup`** → extracts data from **HTML/XML** (used for web scraping).
    
- **`requests`** → Sends **HTTP requests** (GET, POST, etc.) to interact with web pages or APIs.
